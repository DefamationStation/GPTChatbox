# GPTChatbox
A simple light chatbox app that lets you use your OpenAI API key 

Download the .py (or the .exe if you're feeling adventurus) and config files to your desktop. 
Open the config file with a text editor and insert your openAI API key. 
Run the .py using VSCode and press the play button on the top right.
